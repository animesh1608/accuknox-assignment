Detailed Technical Specifications:

1. User Sign-Up:
	a. User Interface:
		Design a sign-up form with the following fields: first name, last name, email address, password etc.
		Include appropriate labels, placeholders, and input validations for each field.
	b. Data Validation:
		Verify that all required fields (first name, last name, email address, and password etc) are filled correctly.
		Validate the email address format to ensure it follows the standard format (e.g., name@example.com).
	c. Unique Email:
		Check if the provided email address is already registered in the system to avoid duplicate accounts. If already registered then show error - "User is alredy registed with this email" 
	d. Submit button:
		When the user clicks on it, make an API call to backend and provide appropriate feedback to the user, indicating that account created - "Account created successfully, please verify your email address".

TDD Approach:
	Write test cases to validate the data validation logic, including checks for empty fields, valid email format, and strong password requirements.
	Write test cases to verify that user sign-up information is stored correctly on click of submit button.


3. Email Verification / TOTP Verification: **(We can use any one of the give approach to verify the email address)**
	a. Email Verification:
		Backend will send a verification email to the user's email address.
   When the user clicks on it, provide appropriate feedback to the user, indicating that their email address has been successfully verified.
	b. TOTP Verification:
		  User Input: Provide a field for the user to enter the TOTP code they received over the email.
			Validation : Verify that the provided TOTP code is valid and matches the generated code on the server side, by making API call to backend.

	 TDD Approach:
		Write test cases to validate that the user can enter the TOTP code received from an authenticator application during the sign-up process.
		Write test cases to verify that the provided TOTP code is validated correctly and matches the generated code on the server side.

5. User Login:
	a. Authentication Mechanism:
		Design a login form that requests the user's email address, password and TOTP code for authentication.
		Include appropriate labels, placeholders, and input validations for each field.
	b. Credential Verification:
		Validate the provided email and password against the stored credentials in the database.
	c. TOTP Verification:
		Verify that the provided TOTP code is valid and matches the generated code on the server side, by making API call to backend.
	d. Session Management:
		Store the JWT token securely, such as in a session store or encrypted cookies.
		Implement session expiration to automatically log out inactive users after a certain period of inactivity.

	TDD Approach:
	Write test cases to ensure that the user can successfully authenticate using their email, password, and TOTP code.
	Write test cases to validate the correctness of the provided email and password against the stored credentials in the database.
	Write test cases to verify that the provided TOTP code matches the stored secret key for the user.


Additional Considerations:
	Security:
		Implement secure coding practices to prevent common security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
		Apply proper encryption and hashing techniques to protect sensitive user information.
	Error Handling:
		Implement error handling mechanisms to handle exceptional cases, such as network failures, database errors, or invalid user inputs.
		Implement error boundaries to catch JavaScript errors at run time anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI
		Provide clear and user-friendly error messages to guide users in resolving issues.
	Compatibility:
		Test and ensure compatibility with various web browsers and devices to provide a seamless experience for users across platforms.




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several popular testing libraries and approaches available. Here are some commonly used ones, along with the reasoning behind their selection:

1. React Testing Library (RTL):
	React Testing Library is a widely adopted testing library that encourages testing components based on their user interactions and behavior.
	It focuses on testing how users interact with the application rather than the internal implementation details, resulting in more robust and maintainable tests.
	RTL provides a simple and intuitive API that closely resembles how users interact with components, making tests more readable and easier to write.
	It promotes best practices, such as avoiding implementation-specific selectors and favoring accessible queries based on component behavior.
	RTL integrates well with other testing libraries, such as Jest, making it a popular choice for testing React applications.

2. Jest:
	Jest is a powerful JavaScript testing framework widely used in the React ecosystem.
	It provides a comprehensive set of features for writing unit tests, including assertions, mocking, code coverage analysis, and snapshot testing.
	Jest works seamlessly with React and supports various testing approaches, such as component rendering, state management, and asynchronous testing.
	It offers a fast and parallel test runner, enabling efficient execution of test suites.
	Jest's snapshot testing feature is particularly useful for automatically detecting unintentional UI changes between test runs.

3. Enzyme:
	Enzyme is a testing utility library specifically designed for React components.
	It provides a shallow rendering API, allowing tests to focus on individual components without rendering child components.
	Enzyme offers a rich set of methods for component querying, traversal, and manipulation, making it useful for asserting component structure and behavior.
	It provides convenient utilities for simulating user interactions, such as clicking buttons and entering text into input fields.
	Enzyme has been widely used in the React community and offers a mature ecosystem of plugins and extensions.

4. Cypress:
Cypress is an end-to-end testing framework for web applications, including React-based ones.
It allows developers to write integration tests that simulate real user interactions and provide an interactive test runner with a live view of the application under test.
Cypress provides a clean and intuitive API for interacting with elements and asserting behavior, making it easier to write and debug tests.
It offers powerful features such as time-travel debugging, automatic waiting for UI elements, and network stubbing.
Cypress supports modern JavaScript frameworks and works well with React, enabling comprehensive testing of the entire application stack.



The choice of testing library depends on various factors, including the testing requirements, team preferences, and project complexity.
React Testing Library (RTL) and Jest are often the go-to choices due to their simplicity, broad adoption, and extensive community support.
